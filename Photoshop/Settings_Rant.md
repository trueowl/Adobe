Those settings are fucking mess, and I’m very sure there’s very little logic behind it. That’s why it’s even more important to understand what data do we need to get from this pile of garbage.

# What’s Wrong?

## WorkSpaces and WorkSpaces (Modified)

W0rkSp4c3z? [Workspace](https://www.lexico.com/definition/workspace) is a word on its own. Both of the directories go with my files, so to me that seems like it’s not that Modified is just for the user content.

## sniffer-out.txt

There are numbers of them. I have 5 files at this very moment, and even if they have some purpose, maybe the software should does its own cleaning? Or keep those files organized. Sniffer-out directory, maybe? 


## Adobe Photoshop 2020 Prefs.psp

The name changes with new versions: `Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 Prefs.psp` easily becomes `Adobe Photoshop 2020 Prefs.psp`. Keeping this name unique per version is a perversion. No, seriously, I just hope there’s a reason behind it, but knowing Adobe…


## MESS

Just a general complain: the logic is absent here and there’s a strong impression different people work on different files with no option to talk to each other and keep the same logic.

`MachinePrefs.psp` vs `Workspace Prefs.psp` vs `WorkSpaces`

I’ll keep this list updated, trying not to blame people, but to point to their indifference to their job.
